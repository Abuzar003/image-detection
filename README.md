# object-detection
This project implements object detection using deep learning models such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) and SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector).

# Features
Model Training: Trains object detection models on annotated datasets.
Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using metrics like mAP (mean Average Precision).
Inference: Performs object detection on images and videos.
Visualization: Visualizes detected objects with bounding boxes and class labels.
